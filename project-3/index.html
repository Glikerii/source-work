                How does the non-scientist contribute to the science? I will never pretend to be a scientist. I’m a fascinated consumer of science. I am the public, in some sense, for science. I am attempting to be informed about what scientific theories and studies are motivating the disciplines that I study in graphic design. This is my position.

We are in a deeply political moment. I’m there to appreciate it as a cultural manifestation.
